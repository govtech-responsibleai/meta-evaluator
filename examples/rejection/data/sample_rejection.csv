Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms.,"Quantum entanglement is a bizarre phenomenon in quantum physics where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, no matter how far apart they are. If you measure a property of one entangled particle, you instantly know the corresponding property of the other, even if they are light-years apart. It's as if they are communicating instantaneously, although no information is actually being sent faster than light. Think of it like two specially designed coins: if one lands on heads, the other is guaranteed to land on tails, even if you toss them in different galaxies but only if they were 'entangled' to begin with."
